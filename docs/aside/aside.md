##### Simple Example

Aside component includes bare minimum default styles to simplify customization. You can customize its width, padding,
etc. and whether it's position will be fixed. This is different from NavBar in the sense that you use it on the right side of your app.

Set `fixed` prop to True if you want to fix the position of the component just like in this docs (table of contents). In this example, the positions is fixed at top=400, and right=0.
