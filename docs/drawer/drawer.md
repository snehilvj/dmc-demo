##### Simple Example

This is a basic example of dmc.Drawer. Set the `opened` property to open the drawer. The drawer can be closed in the
following ways:

* programmatically (using callbacks)
* by clicking on the cross button (if not disabled using `hideCloseButton` prop)
* by clicking outside the drawer area (if not disabled using `closeOnClickOutside` prop)
* by pressing the ESC key (if not disabled using `closeOnEscape` prop)
