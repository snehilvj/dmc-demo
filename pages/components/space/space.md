Space | Add horizontal or vertical spacing from theme

### Simple Usage

In general, you'd want to use `style` prop but if you want to have access to Mantine theme.spacing, you can use the Space component.

> example:components/space/_simple.py

### Direct spacing

You can use spacing without theme.spacing as well.
